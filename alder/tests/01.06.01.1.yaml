title: "CONSOLE CONTROL MANUAL RESET"
num: 01.06.01.1 
pdf: 74

# Each block on the page will have its own section.
# The blocks are organized in a grid coordinate system
# that is designated by the "coo:" tag below.  "coo: 2D"
# means column 2, row D.  There is no row I.
#
# We enter the columns left to right. Inside of each column
# we enter the rows top to bottom.  For example, page 74 
# has these blocks: 
#
# 2D, 2D, 2F, 3C, 3D, 4D, 5A, 5C, 5E, 5G, 5J
#
# The inputs to the block are on the left side of the 
# block and have single-letter identifiers.  The outputs 
# of the block are on the right side of the block and 
# have single letter identifiers.
#
# We only need to record the block inputs using the "inp:"
# tag.
#
# Block inputs will either connect to:
# 
# 1. A wire on the left side of the page using the [xxxxx] 
#    identifier format.
# 2. The output of another block on the page using the XX.Y
#    identifier format where XX is the block coordinate and 
#    Y is the output pin letter.
#
# It is possible that a block input will be connected to more
# than one thing. Use comma-separation to make a list.
#
# There is no need to capture the block outputs.
#
# NOTE: here are a few pieces of information on the block that 
# do not need to be captured.
#
# NOTE: Use image of page 74 as an example to compare the original
# diagram with the information recorded here.
